# Derivative Rules:

## 📘 Basic Derivative Rules

- **Constant Rule**  
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx}[c] = 0
  $$

- **Power Rule**  
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = nx^{n-1} \quad \text{for any real } n
  $$

- **Constant Multiple Rule**  
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx}[c \cdot f(x)] = c \cdot \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]
  $$

- **Sum and Difference Rule**  
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx}[f(x) \pm g(x)] = \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)] \pm \frac{d}{dx}[g(x)]
  $$

- **Product Rule**  
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx}[f(x) \cdot g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
  $$

- **Quotient Rule**  
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right] = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}
  $$

## 🔁 Chain Rule

If $y = f(g(x))$, then:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
$$

## 📈 Common Function Derivatives

- **Exponential Functions**  
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx}[e^x] = e^x
  $$
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx}[e^{u(x)}] = e^{u(x)} \cdot u'(x)
  $$

- **Logarithmic Functions**  
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx}[\ln x] = \frac{1}{x}
  $$
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx}[\ln(u(x))] = \frac{u'(x)}{u(x)}
  $$

> _Note: Trigonometric derivatives like $\sin$ and $\cos$ are not required._

## 🧠 Example: Chain Rule

Let $f(x) = \ln(3x^2 + 1)$

Then:
$$
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[\ln(3x^2 + 1)] = \frac{6x}{3x^2 + 1}
$$

# Practice Exam 1 - FRQs

## Problem 1

Let $f(x) = x - log(x)$,  
where log(.) donates the natural log base algorithm

1. Show that f(x) has a unique global min. Justify your answer

Find $f(x), f'(x), f''(x)$, set $f'(x) = 0$ to get the critical points, if we can show that $f'(x) = 0$ has only one critical point, and that $f''(x)$ is concave up at that point, then that will be the unique global min

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= x - \ln(x) \\
f'(x) &= 1 - \frac{1}{x} \\
0 &= 1 - \frac{1}{x} \\
\frac{1}{x} &= 1 \\
x &= 1 \\
f''(x) &= \frac{1}{x^2} \\
f''(1) &= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Because $f(x)$ has one critical point at $x=1$, and the second derivative is positive, the function is concave up, meaning that $f(x)$ has a unique global minimum at that point. 

2. Let $x_0 = 2$ be the initial point used in the gradient descent algorithm. What will $x_1$ be based on the gradient descent algorithm, if the step size is set to $η = 0.5$?

3. Derive the range of values for the step size parameter $η$, so that gradient descent is convergent? Justify your answer.

4. Suppose that somebody that does not know how to derive the range of eligible step sizes $η$, decided to use an initial $η = 2$ for initial point $x_0 = 2$. Explain what calculations the backtracking line search algorithm will check to select and appropriate step size $η_0$ to proceed calculating the next update $x_1$.


# Practice Exam 1 - MCQs

## Question 1: Which direction does the gradient descent algorithm move in each iter-ation?

- $\Box$ Random direction
- $\Box$ Direction of the gradient
- \checkbox{1} Opposite to the gradient
- $\Box$ Along the eigenvectors of the Hessian

## Question 2: If the step size (learning rate) for the optimization problem of a statistical model is too large, gradient descent can:

- $\Box$ Converge slowly
- $\Box$ Not converge
- $\Box$ Overfit the data
- $\Box$ Always converge faster
